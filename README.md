## Hi there I'm Adeyinka! ðŸ‘‹ 
I help organizations protect what matters by building practical GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) solutions.

An emerging Cybersecurity GRC Analyst. With 4+ years as a chartered Accountant, Iâ€™ve developed a strong focus on risk, internal controls, and regulatory compliance â€” skills that have been at the center of my work in the financial management and consulting industry. I now apply this foundation in cybersecurity, focusing on audits, compliance reporting, vendor risk, and building secure, policy-driven information systems.

This GitHub repo is my learning lab â€” I document hands-on GRC projects, from ISO 27001 implementation for a fictional hospital to privacy policy design aligned with NDPR. This is where I turn my theoretical knowledge into actionable frameworks and processes.

## What Iâ€™ve Achieved So Far

1. Led and delivered security awareness training to a group of professional accountants, educating them on cybersecurity risks in finance and equipping them with best practices to protect sensitive financial data.

2. Designed privacy policies template tailored for influencers and content creators, ensuring GDPR/NDPR compliance and showcasing the importance of data privacy and security.

3. Collaborated with group members on an in-depth spear-phishing analysis, identifying five key weaknesses and recommending more effective and proactive measures to reduce a reoccurence using employee awareness as part of a group project.

4. Shared practical cybersecurity and digital safety tips within my close community, promoting secure online habits and raising awareness about personal data protection in everyday digital use.
