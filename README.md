Emerging Cybersecurity GRC, & Data Privacy Analyst

I'm passionate about securing organizations through governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC). I'm building expertise by working on real-world security challenges and documenting my journey here. I use this repository to document my hands-on projects and build expertise through real-world security challenges. 

## What Iâ€™ve Achieved So Far

âœ… Designed privacy policies tailored for influencers, ensuring GDPR/NDPR compliance.

âœ… Conducted an in-depth spear-phishing analysis, identifying five key weaknesses in data protection and employee awareness as part of a group project.

âœ… Performed multiple network scans using Nmap, identifying and mitigating security risks to protect sensitive data.

## Current Project:

- Risk assessment and management,
