## Hi there I'm Adeyinka! ðŸ‘‹ 
I help organizations protect what matters by building practical GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) solutions.

An emerging Cybersecurity GRC Analyst. With 4+ years in professional accounting, I bring a risk and controls-first mindset into cybersecurity, especially in areas like audits, compliance reporting, vendor reviews. Now, I'm applying that experience into building robust information security processes.

This GitHub repo is my learning lab â€” I document hands-on GRC projects, from ISO 27001 implementation for a fictional hospital to privacy policy design aligned with NDPR. This is where I turn my theoretical knwoledge into actionable frameworks and processes.

## What Iâ€™ve Achieved So Far

1. Led and delivered security awareness training to a group of professional accountants, educating them on cybersecurity risks in finance and equipping them with best practices to protect sensitive financial data.

2. Designed privacy policies template tailored for influencers and content creators, ensuring GDPR/NDPR compliance and showcasing the importance of data privacy and security.

3. Collaborated with group members on an in-depth spear-phishing analysis, identifying five key weaknesses and recommending more effective and proactive measures to reduce a reoccurence using employee awareness as part of a group project.
