## Hi there I'm Adeyinka! ðŸ‘‹

Emerging Cybersecurity GRC, & Data Privacy Analyst

I'm passionate about securing organizations through governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC). I'm building expertise by working on real-world security challenges and documenting my journey here. I use this repository to document my hands-on projects and build expertise through real-world security challenges. 

Current Project:
Iâ€™m working on Security Policies for a Newly Built Healthcare Organization (RFK Hospitals) to establish cybersecurity, data protection, and privacy best practices. This includes key areas such as 
- Risk assessment and management,
- Access control, incident response,
- Employee security awareness, and
- Compliance with industry standards.
  

I also document my progress on LinkedIn, where I share insights and lessons learned. Letâ€™s connect!
