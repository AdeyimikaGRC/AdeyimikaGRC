RFK Hospital outlines our guidelines and provisions for preserving the security of our data and technology infrastructure.

**1.1 Purpose**

1. This policy applies to all information assets, systems, personnel, and third parties involved in data processing activities across RFK Hospital Ltd. It covers the secure handling, storage, access, and transmission of information within the hospital’s environment. All data processing and information collection must align with applicable national and international standards, including the Nigeria Data Protection Act (NDPA), relevant healthcare regulations (e.g., HEFAMAA, FMoH), HIPAA (for any cross-border obligations), and ISO/IEC 27001\.  
   **1.2 Scope**

This policy must be communicated by supervisors to all employees and all others as mentioned above who have access to or manage RFK Hospital digital information. This information security policy is technology independent, and does not include implementation standards, processes or procedures. This policy defines how the Hospital  will secure electronic information, which is found within:  
      i.The RFK Hospital infrastructure

     ii. Key Business System data and information.

                         iii. Security of information held in electronic form on any Hospital computer.

**2\.  IT ASSETS POLICY** 

1. This IT  Assets management policy provides a framework for the appropriate and effective management of IT equipment ( hardware and software)  from procurement to disposal in RFK Hospital.  
2.  It is the policy of the Hospital that all departmental information technology hardware assets are used for business to maintain accurate records in a safe,  cost effective manner consistent with applicable laws and regulations.

   **2.1 Purpose**

 	 The purpose of this policy is to establish the principles and controls for managing IT assets throughout their lifecycle, ensuring their confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It supports RFK Hospitals' broader information security objectives and regulatory compliance with standards such as NDPR and HIPAA, and aligns with best practices outlined in ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST standards for asset management..  
 This policy shall provide a clear instruction on the appropriate management of physical IT Assets.

	**2.2 Scope**  
This policy applies to all RFK Hospitals personnel, including employees, contractors, vendors, and any third-party entities who have access to the Hospital’s  IT assets.
