**4\. SECURITY OBJECTIVES** 

At RFK Hospital, our security objectives establish a strong foundation for safeguarding patient data, hospital operations, and information assets. These objectives align with global and local regulatory requirements, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of all data.

#### **4.1 Confidentiality**

* Protect patient data, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI), from unauthorized access or disclosure.

* Implement strict access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data. This includes multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing critical systems.

* Secure communication channels for data transmission, both internally and externally, using encryption protocols.  
    
* Ensure compliance with NDPR, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and other relevant standards, such as conducting periodic audits to assess compliance.

#### **4.2 Integrity**

* Maintain the accuracy and reliability of patient records and medical data by implementing data validation mechanisms.

* Implement measures to prevent unauthorized modification of critical information, including role-based access controls and data encryption at rest.

* Establish audit trails and logging mechanisms to track data changes and ensure accountability, enabling detailed review and traceability.

#### **4.3 Availability**

* Ensure critical healthcare systems remain operational and accessible when needed by implementing high availability solutions and redundant systems.

* Implement robust disaster recovery and business continuity plans, including regular testing to ensure minimal downtime in case of disruption.

* Protect IT infrastructure from disruptions caused by cyber threats, system failures, or natural disasters by using advanced monitoring tools and vulnerability management programs.

#### **4.4 Risk Management**

* Identify, assess, and mitigate risks associated with patient data and hospital operations through regular risk assessments, conducted annually and whenever significant changes occur.

* Perform continuous monitoring using automated tools to detect emerging threats and vulnerabilities.

* Implement tailored risk mitigation strategies, including regular security assessments, vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing, to proactively address security gaps.

* Engage in ongoing cybersecurity training for staff to enhance their understanding of risk factors and their role in mitigating them.

#### **4.5 Compliance & Regulatory Adherence**

* Align security policies with applicable healthcare security and privacy regulations, including NDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001\.  
    
* Ensure adherence to these standards through regular audits, internal reviews, and documented evidence of compliance efforts.

* Establish continuous improvement mechanisms to stay updated with evolving regulations, ensuring that RFK Hospital maintains a high level of regulatory compliance at all times.

##### **4.5.1 Regulatory Frameworks**

RFK Hospital operates under the following regulatory frameworks to ensure compliance and data protection:

* **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act):** U.S. regulation for protecting patient health information (PHI).

* **ISO 27001:** International standard for information security management systems (ISMS), which provides a framework for managing sensitive company information.

* **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF):** Provides guidelines for identifying, protecting, detecting, responding, and recovering from cyber threats.

* **NDPR (Nigeria Data Protection Regulation):** Nigeria’s data protection regulation ensures privacy rights and the security of personal data.  
* **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: As RFK Hospital may treat EU nationals, we ensure compliance with GDPR, which regulates the privacy and security of personal data for EU citizens.

#### **4.6 Security Awareness & Training**

* Educate our staff on cybersecurity best practices and data protection policies through ongoing training programs, conducted quarterly, to ensure staff are consistently updated on the latest security practices.

* Conduct regular training sessions to reduce human-related security risks, including phishing awareness, password management, and handling of sensitive data.

* Conduct regular tabletop exercises and live simulations (at least annually) to test the effectiveness of the incident response plan and ensure staff familiarity with emergency protocols.

* Ensure rapid response and recovery from security incidents by maintaining an incident response team (IRT) with specialized skills, clear roles, and access to the necessary resources.

* After each incident, perform a post-incident analysis to identify root causes, assess the impacts, and implement improvements to strengthen security measures, reducing the likelihood of similar incidents occurring in the future.
